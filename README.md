👋 Hi, I’m @roshanvino  

🧠 I’m curious about how **data, probability, and computation** can be used to understand complex systems — especially financial markets  

📊 I enjoy working with **large datasets**, building **analytical pipelines**, and turning noisy data into insight using **Python**  

🔬 Recently, I’ve been:
- Building and evaluating **algorithmic trading strategies** in simulated markets  
- Applying **reinforcement learning and stochastic modelling** to financial data  
- Designing reproducible experiments and analysing results with pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib  

🛠️ My interests sit at the intersection of **software engineering, data analysis, and finance**, and I enjoy projects that require both technical depth and critical thinking  

🤝 I’m open to collaborating on projects involving:
- Data analysis & visualisation  
- Quantitative or financial modelling  
- Python-based research tools  
- Systems that work with real-world, imperfect data
